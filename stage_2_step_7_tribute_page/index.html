     <h3 id="headline">Red pandas are endangered </h3>
          
            <h5 id="facts"> Their forest homes are being cut down, and poachers hunt them for their fur.  Experts have estimated their total population has declined by 40% over the past twenty years. At just 50-65cm tall, these pandas are tiny but certainly mighty.<h5>
    
         <h3 id="headline">Red pandas 'glow in the dark</h3>
    
       <h5 id="facts">The white on the red panda's face is "almost luminescent" and can guide a mother's lost cubs in the darkness.</h5> 
              
               <h3 id="headline">Red pandas are not related to giant pandas</h3>
    
             <h5 id="facts"> The red panda's name might lead you to think that its closest relative is the giant panda, but studies show that they are most closely related to raccoons! Recent genetic research also associates them with the family Mustelidae, which includes weasels, otters, and wolverines.</h5>
    
    
     <h3 id="headline">Red pandas are the first panda</h3>
             <h5 id="facts"> Red pandas were discovered 50 years before the giant panda by Georges-Frédéric Cuvier - a French zoologist and paleontologist. spend about 90 percent of their time in the trees in the mountains of Nepal, Myanmar, and central China. </h5>

               <h5 id="facts">  This is how they avoid predators, such as snow leopards. Their reddish coats and white face markings provide camouflage in the red-brown moss and white lichen of trees where they live. (They only leave trees to.. use the facilities) </h5>
    
          <h3 id="headline">Red panda diet? 98% bamboo</h3>
                <h5 id="facts">​Red pandas have to eat 20 to 30 percent of their body weight in bamboo which means they can eat up to 20,000 leaves each day. They will also occasionally eat eggs, insects, flowers, birds and small mammals when available.</h5>
              
    
           <h3 id="headline">Red panda's have six digits on their front paws.. or 'pseudo-thumbs'</h3>
            <h5 id="facts"> Red pandas have an enlarged, modified wrist bone they use for climbing trees and grabbing bamboo stems. Giant pandas have pseudo-thumbs as well but for different reasons. This is an example of "convergent evolution" which is when two unrelated animals faced with similar circumstances evolve to look similar. </h5>
              
        <h3 id="headline">Red Pandas Stand on Their Hind Legs</h3>
    <h5 id="facts">When provoked or threatened, red pandas will stand on their hind legs to appear larger, like this red panda who forgot this rock was there and decided to square up. Tiny but mighty!<br> <br> <img
